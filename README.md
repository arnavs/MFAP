## About

Dave Backus was a professor of mine at NYU. I was lucky enough to take this class with him before he [passed away](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/economics/people/memoriam/david-backus), suddenly and early, in 2016.

He was enormously supportive to all his students, and was the first one to nudge me on the route to econ research.

### MFAP

Materials for **Macroeconomic Foundations for Asset Prices** (ECON-UB-233), a course at NYU's Stern School of Business about the mathematics of asset prices and the macroeconomic foundations for them.   The repository includes TeX, Matlab, and Python files for notes, assignments, quizzes, etc.  The outputs (mostly pdf files) and a more complete description of the course are posted on the [course site]  (https://sites.google.com/site/nyusternmacrofoundations/home).
